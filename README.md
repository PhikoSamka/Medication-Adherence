# Predicting Patient Adherence to Treatment Plans  

## **Project Overview**  
### **Objective**  
The goal of this project is to predict whether patients will adhere to their prescribed treatment plans based on various factors. By identifying at-risk patients early, healthcare providers can:  
- Improve patient outcomes.  
- Reduce healthcare costs.  
- Optimize resource allocation.  

### **Problem Statement**  
Non-adherence to treatment plans is a persistent and costly challenge in healthcare. Patients failing to follow their prescribed plans contribute to:  
- Worsened health outcomes.  
- Increased healthcare expenditures.  
- Unnecessary hospitalizations.  
This project aims to analyze contributing factors and leverage **predictive modeling** to aid healthcare professionals in improving patient compliance.

## **Dataset Structre**  
The dataset contains **180,000 observations** with the following features:  

| **Column Name**       | **Description**                                                |  
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|

| `Age`                 | Age of the patient (numerical).                                |  
| `Gender`              | Gender of the patient (Male or Female).                       |  
| `Prescription_period` | Duration of the prescription in days.                         |

| `Alcoholism`          | Binary indicator (1 for alcoholism, 0 otherwise).            |  
| `HyperTension`        | Binary indicator (1 for hypertension, 0 otherwise).          |  
| `Smokes`              | Binary indicator (1 for smoking, 0 otherwise).               |  
| `Tuberculosis`        | Binary indicator (1 for tuberculosis, 0 otherwise).          |  
| `Sms_Reminder`        | Binary indicator (1 if the patient received an SMS reminder, 0 otherwise). |  
| `Adherence`           | Binary target variable (1 for adherence, 0 for non-adherence). |  


## **Adherence (Target) Distribution**  
![Adherence Distribution](resources/adherence_distribution.png)

The data is not significantly imbalanced:
- **Non-Adherence**: Approximately 69%
- **Adherence**: Approximately 31%

Typically, imbalance-handling techniques are applied when one class constitutes only 10â€“20% of the data compared to the other. Since the class distribution in our dataset does not fall into this range, we will not apply any imbalance-handling techniques for now.

## **Model Training and Evaluation Metrics**  
### **Trained Models**  
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

### **Evaluation Metrics**  
- **Accuracy**: Measures overall correctness of predictions.

The `Random Forest` model was selected based on its ability to maximize recall, minimize false negatives, and achieve competitive performance while being efficient in terms of computational resources and latency.

#### **Key Reasons for Choosing Random Forest:**

- **Resource Efficiency**: RF performs well with limited computational resources and is faster to train compared to models like CatBoost.
- **Latency**: RF provides low-latency predictions, making it suitable for real-time applications.
- **Performance**: RF achieved the second-highest AUC score, balancing recall and precision effectively.

## Choosing Appropriate Threshold for Predictions using ROC Curve of Random Forest

![Random Forest ROC-AUC](resources/Random_forest_ROC_curve.png)

### Threshold Selection:

Based on the ROC curve, the threshold of **0.69** was chosen, as it corresponds to the elbow point on the curve.

At this threshold:
- **True Positive Rate (TPR)**: 0.815928, meaning that 81.59% of positive cases are correctly identified.
- **False Positive Rate (FPR)**: 0.089679, which represents a 8.97% rate of false positives.

This threshold provides a strong recall while keeping false positives at an acceptable level. It is an ideal choice for this application, where false negatives (missed cases) could lead to serious consequences, such as hospitalizations.
